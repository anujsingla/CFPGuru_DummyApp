/**

CFP Guru app - Your Idea, our structure

Tech stack - React, Patternfly, Typescript.
Github link - https://github.com/really-smart-apps/cfp-guru
CFP - Call for proposals.

Recently we made one app related to CFP. It helps you to structure the abstract of the conference talk.
Suppose you have some idea in your mind to give a talk at the conference, we have made a form which will ask you a couple of questions. As per your answers, we will provide you abstract of the conference in the pdf.

We are working on this app, and if you would like to contribute, you can do it. 
We will make this app from scratch and try to cover everything.
- Make a project with "create react app"
- Integrate patternfly
- Download other libraries like lodash, sass, localforage
- Make app layout and routes
- Make CFP form
- Persist form data in the browser cache, so it will persist when the user refreshes the form.
- Deploy app
